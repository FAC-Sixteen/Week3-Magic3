# What we worked on üïú 

## Day 1Ô∏è‚É£ (worked as a three on 1 laptop)

* Set up Food Api using TheMealDB API

## Day 2Ô∏è‚É£ (worked as a three in morning, as 2 and 1 in afternoon)

* Set up movie API (using MovieDB API) and loaded information into HTML.
* Created Readme.
* Added CSS elements to make it look great. (Sylvia started this in the morning)
* Updated our user journey.

## Day 3Ô∏è‚É£(working mainly individually, but sometimes as a 3 or 2.)

Based on rasied issues, we ..
1. Removed some non-working fields in the dropdown select.
2. Made the entire website into a progressive web app.
3. Added some margins to the dropdown selections.
4. Fixed some functionality issues with the movie selection api.
5. Added functionality to change from hover to onclick showing information.

# Stretch Goals

Some features we wanted to add if we had a bit more time.

1. Spinning wheel. 

Runs through all selections similar to a slot machine, before picking a final option.

2. Fortune Cookie Api idea. 

Wanted to add another api with a fortune cookie which when clicked on, gives a random piece of advice and a fortune cookie which splits apart using an .SVG.

3. Add recursion and refactoring code. 

We didn't manage to fully refactor our code due to lack of time but if we had more time this is something we would have likes to do.

4. Add filters allowing users to select movie genres and type of cuisine. (COMPLETED).
